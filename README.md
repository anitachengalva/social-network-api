# Social Network API

## Description

This project is an API for social network web applications. This API allows users to share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

Purely utilizing back-end programming, [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) is used for routing, [MongoDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) for a NoSQL database, and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages for Object Data Modeling (ODM) and to create a connection between MongoDB and the Node.js Javascipt.

Seed data has been created for the sake of demonstrating functionality when testing the API in [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia).

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```


## Installation and Usage

To use this API, you will want to fork this GitHub repository containing the back-end code. From there, you will need to perform a git clone operation on the forked repository to bring it to your local machine.   

This code should be placed at the root of your Social Network project file structure, while you work on front-end code contained in a `views` and `public` folder at the same level.    

In your front-end code, you will need to make API calls to fetch data stored in the database, and use functions to pass the retrieved information through to the Document Object Model (DOM). Additionally, you will need to be able to pass user-input from the user interface of the Social Network back through into the database.    

You will also need to include a `.env` file with your [MongoDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) database password, as well as a `.gitignore` file excluding the following:
```
node_modules
.DS_store
.env
```

In order to run the application, ensure that firstly you have Node.js installed. Then, while in the root of your file structure, run `npm init -y` in your Command Line Interface (CLI) to initialize your local directory. Then run `npm i` to install all relavent node package dependancies. Lastly, entering `npm run start` to the CLI should launch the server.
